# object = initialise(sda, scl, ldac, address)

Creates an instance of the chip.  The initialisation type depends on the SDA, SCL and LDAC pins provided.  If LDAC is irregular, reading and writing the chip address is disabled.  If SDA and SCL do not match the predefined I2C pins, changing the output voltages is disabled.  Both i2c-0 and i2c-1 busses can be used.  Do not forget to provide pull-up resistors for the LDAC line and the I2C-0 lines.

Examples:

chip = initialize(2,3,-1,0x61)       # opens an instance of the chip at address 0x61 and allows changing the output voltages over the i2c-1 bus (the chip address is mandatory)
chip = initialize(16,20,21,-1)       # opens an instance of the chip at an unknown address and allows reading/writing the address
chip = initialize(0,1,16,-1)         # opens an instance of the chip at an unknown address and allows both reading/writing the address and changing the output voltages over the i2c-0 bus
